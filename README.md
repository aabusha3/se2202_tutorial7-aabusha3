# Tutorial7
## Task1: Processing Arrays of Numbers
•	Given two arrays of distances and an offset:
  o	One array represents the distances traveled after the offset.
  o	The other array represents the distances traveled back (not crossing the offset point)
•	We would like to know the total distance traveled away from the offset.

## Task2: Processing Arrays of Objects
Given an array of 2D point(x,y) objects, find the maximum distance between the origin point (0,0) and any point that doesn’t lie on any axes.
-	The euclidean distance between (0,0) and (x,y) = Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y)
